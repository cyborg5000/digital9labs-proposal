# Staying On Top of Revenue Commitments

## Using the CRM to Support Quotes, Handovers, and Invoicing

---

## Why This Matters

Even without complex financial integrations, sales teams still need a reliable way to remember what has been promised, when work starts, and when invoices should be issued. Spreadsheets struggle to keep that information aligned. The CRM gives you a structured home for the details that finance and operations teams rely on.

## Capturing the Right Information at the Deal Stage

**Benefit:** Every approved opportunity includes the data finance needs to invoice quickly.

- Record agreed pricing, payment terms, and expected delivery dates on the deal.
- Attach the final quote or proposal so the latest version is always available.
- Add internal notes for finance or operations about special billing rules.

## Tracking Handover Milestones

**Benefit:** Delivery teams receive clean, complete information when they take over from sales.

- Use pipeline stages to mark when a deal is ready for fulfilment.
- Assign tasks to operations for kickoff meetings or documentation checks.
- Keep milestone updates inside the activity timeline so everyone sees progress.

## Coordinating with Finance Without Integrations

**Benefit:** The CRM becomes the shared reference point for upcoming invoices.

- Filter closed-won deals that have not yet been invoiced and export the list in seconds.
- Leave comments when invoices are issued so sales can follow up with confidence.
- Use custom tags (e.g., "Deposit Paid", "Awaiting Balance") to track payment status.

## Recommended Workflow Between Teams

1. **Sales closes the deal** and completes the financial fields inside the CRM.
2. **Finance reviews weekly** by filtering deals that require invoicing.
3. **Operations updates milestones** within the same record as work progresses.
4. **Sales monitors renewals or repeat work** by setting reminders before contracts expire.

This lightweight process keeps everyone aligned without adding new software.
