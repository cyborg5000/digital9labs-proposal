## Overview

Instead of overwhelming you with long feature lists, the product concentrates on a handful of workflows that create the most value for teams coming from spreadsheets. Each capability is designed to deliver a clear, tangible benefit.

## 1. Shared Contact & Company Records

**Benefit:** Everyone knows who the customer is, how to reach them, and what has happened so far.

- Keep contact details, roles, and notes together in one profile.
- Link people to the companies they represent so context is easy to find.
- Attach key files (quotes, agreements, photos) where the team expects to see them.

## 2. Deal and Pipeline Tracking

**Benefit:** Stay on top of open opportunities without rebuilding spreadsheets every week.

- Organise deals by stage to show what is new, in progress, and ready to close.
- Drag-and-drop updates keep the pipeline current in seconds.

## 3. Task and Reminder Management

**Benefit:** Never forget a promised follow-up, even when the day gets busy.

## 4. Activity Timeline

**Benefit:** Anyone can pick up the conversation with full context.

- Capture key outcomes or customer feedback immediately after the interaction.
