# Digital9 Labs CRM Presentation – Updated Messaging Summary

## Overview
A 15-slide presentation for SME owners who are still managing customers in spreadsheets. The deck now focuses on the practical benefits of moving to a simple, shared CRM that keeps contacts, documents, and finance notes in one place. Messaging centres on escaping “spreadsheet hell” rather than promoting advanced integrations or automation the product does not offer.

## Slide Highlights
1. **Title:** "Escape Spreadsheet Chaos" – positions the CRM as a calm, central workspace.
2. **Problem:** Real-world pains of spreadsheets (multiple versions, missed follow-ups, manual reporting).
3. **Solution:** One workspace linking contacts, documents, finance notes, and light reporting.
4. **Benefits:** Emphasis on shared context, predictable follow-ups, faster reporting.
5. **Pipeline:** Simple stages that keep weekly reviews focused on action, not admin.
6. **Finance:** Capturing quote and payment details so finance stays aligned without extra tools.
7. **Impact:** Qualitative gains such as shorter meeting prep, quicker handovers, and confident reporting.
8. **Adoption Support:** Guided onboarding, playbooks, and ongoing check-ins.
9. **All-in-One Hub:** Before/after comparison showing the move from scattered sheets to one CRM.
10. **Implementation:** Lightweight five-step rollout with business-hours support.
11. **Pricing:** Seat-based Starter, Growth, and Company plans with bespoke quotes.
12. **Customer Stories:** Anecdotes highlighting improved visibility and follow-through.
13. **Advantages:** Focus on essentials, linked information, predictable costs, and SME-friendly support.
14. **Next Steps:** Invite to share current setup, see data in the CRM, and roll out with help.
15. **Contact:** Business-hours response expectations and the key info to include when reaching out.

## Visual Direction
- Maintains the blue palette but swaps security/integration imagery for visuals that reinforce organisation and teamwork.
- Removes references to WhatsApp/email automation, intelligent lead scoring, and third-party integrations.
- Keeps layouts clean and familiar so spreadsheet users feel at home.

## Key Changes Made
- Replaced feature-heavy language with benefit-first copy across every slide.
- Removed unsupported claims (AI, WhatsApp integration, 24/7 support, 300% ROI, etc.).
- Reframed pricing around user tiers and guided onboarding instead of fixed automation-heavy bundles.
- Updated testimonials and anecdotes to reflect achievable outcomes (less scrambling, faster handovers, cleaner reporting).
- Adjusted calls-to-action to emphasise conversation, guided trials, and implementation support.

## How to Use the Deck Now
- Ideal for conversations with teams evaluating their first CRM purchase.
- Use alongside the refreshed documentation in `docs/` for a consistent narrative.
- Tailor the anecdotes (Slide 12) with industry-specific examples before client meetings.
